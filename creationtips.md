## How to redirect to other pages
Sience Version 1.0, You could only make 1 home page, but 1.6 added a feature where you can make redirects to this. but a tutorial was never made.
## So how do i do it?
How you can redirect normally is by adding an 
```html
<a>
```
element with this link

```
https://we09532.github.io/SnailNet?starterurl=mycoolpage
````
*replace mycoolpage with your actuall page name*
### Extra Info
#### Parameters
- starterurl - Redirect URL
- embedredirect - if this exists then it will disable music in the redirect. this is better for code because it wont overlap sounds
